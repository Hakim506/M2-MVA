# Data Challenge - Kernel Methods
Nils Baillie and Abdoul-Hakim Ahamada, M2 MVA, ENS Paris-Saclay

## Description

In this project, we explore the effectiveness of kernel methods for classification tasks involving non-linear data relationships. We consider well-known techniques such as Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), Kernel k Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). By optimizing hyperparameters and analyzing resulting scores, our objective is to gain insights into how these methods perform and their suitability for image classification tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- Anaconda or Miniconda installed (optional, if using Anaconda environments)
- Required Python libraries installed:
  - os
  - time
  - random
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - cvxopt
  - importlib
- **Datasets and associated features downloaded from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gr13MINUumyX-MxpJjo7UjON9R6lQ-cD?usp=sharing) and placed in the project directory**

## Usage

1. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd "Downloads\Hakim506 M2-MVA main KM-Data%20Challenge\KM\Data Challenge"
```

2. **Execute Script**: Run the script using Python in your PowerShell terminal.

```bash
python start.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors during script execution, consider executing the `main.ipynb` file.
- Ensure that you have Python installed on your system and that it is accessible from the command line.
- If using Anaconda or Miniconda, make sure you have activated the appropriate environment before running the script.
